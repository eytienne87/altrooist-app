# Altrooist

**Altrooist** is a Ruby on Rails app that suggests users volunteer organizations based on their location and preferences.

We built the app at Le Wagon Montreal in the Summer of 2021 as part of our final project, [Andrea Pirolo](https://github.com/ajpirolo), [Van Thao Huynh](https://github.com/vanthaohuynh) and I.

Feel free to reach out to us on Linkedin if you have any questions :wave:
